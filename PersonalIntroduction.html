  <h1>Personal Introduction</h1>
</span>
<div>
  <p> My name is Will Carrasco, and I'm a 22 year old sudent at Chico State
    University. I began my college education at Cuesta College, a Junior College
    in San Luis Obispo where I took a broad range of classes.
   <p>I studied there for 2 years, then transfored to San Rosa JC with the
    idea of focusing on Geology. Once I finished my last year at the JC I transfored
    to Chico and declared the major Geology. I went this pathway for a year, before
    taking a Planned Educational Leave and coming to the conclusion that
    Geology wasn't for me.
   </p>
   <p>This led to me rethinking what I should study in College and what
    could help me make a career, so I came to the conclosion that computers
    would be a great field to get in to. This led me to changed my major to
    Computer Information Systems and here I am this current spring semester.
