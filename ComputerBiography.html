  <h1>Computer Biography</h1>

<div>
  <p> I don't have very much experience prior to what I've learned this semester
    about web developement. I'm familiar with computers in general, I've played
    computer games since I was in middle school.
  </p>
   <p>While playing World of Warcraft, I would create macros and in game commands
    to execute certain actions, which seemed advanced to me at the time. I have
    always had a connection with computers and enjoy using them, so learning more
    about how web pages and programs are created really fascinates me.
