  <p> When not in school, during breaks I'm ussually either baby sitting for families
    in the Bay Area where my parents live, or working for my father's general
    contracting company.
   <p>In my free time I enjoy hiking and hunting for edible
    mushrooms. While there is hiking in the surrounding area of Chico, I haven't
    had much luck hunting for mushrooms.
   </p>
   <p> Below is a picture of an edible mushroom I have personal found, it's name
    is Hericium americanum. Mushrooms can be tricky to itentify if you don't know
    what you're looking for, lucky I have spent many hours learning how to
    correctly itentify them.
